## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑📊 Customer Segmentation
## 🌟 Overview

Customer Segmentation is a machine learning project that groups customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.
This allows businesses to better understand their customers, personalize marketing strategies, and improve decision-making.

## ✨ Features

🔍 Identify customer segments using clustering techniques.

📊 Visualize customer groups in 2D/3D space.

🖥 Simple and modular codebase for easy extension.

📈 Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and scaling included.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📊 Pandas & NumPy (data handling)

🤖 Scikit-Learn (ML algorithms)

📉 Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

📦 Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (exploration & app interface)

## 🚀 Installation

📥 Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Muhammed-AlReay/Customer-Segmentation.git
cd Customer-Segmentation


🏗 Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


📦 Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


▶ Run the notebook or app:

jupyter notebook   # If using notebook
streamlit run app.py   # If using Streamlit

## 📌 Usage

Load the dataset (e.g., customer spending, demographics, or e-commerce data).

Run the clustering algorithm (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, etc.).

Visualize customer segments in charts and analyze their behavior.

Use the insights to design targeted marketing strategies.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset may include features such as:

👥 Customer ID

💵 Annual Income

🛒 Spending Score / Purchase Frequency

🎂 Age

📍 Location / Demographics

🔮 Future Enhancements

📊 Add advanced clustering (Gaussian Mixture Models, Deep Clustering).

🌐 Deploy as a web app with Streamlit/Dash.

🤝 Integrate with CRM systems for real-time segmentation.

📈 Add recommendation engine for personalized offers.
